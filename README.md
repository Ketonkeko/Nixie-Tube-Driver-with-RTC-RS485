Nixie Driver for Nixie Clock and Display Project with RTC and RS485 
# 🔥 Nixie Driver for Nixie Clock & Display

This project is a **Nixie tube driver** designed for **Nixie clock and display applications**, featuring **RTC (Real-Time Clock) support** and **RS485 communication**. The driver controls Nixie tubes for displaying time or numerical data while maintaining accurate timekeeping and supporting serial communication.

## 📌 Features

- 🕰 **RTC Integration** – Keeps accurate time even when powered off.  
- 🔗 **RS485 Communication** – Enables long-distance and reliable data transmission.  
- 🔥 **Nixie Tube Control** – Supports various Nixie tube displays.  
- 🔄 **Adjustable Brightness & Effects** – Smooth transitions and dimming support.  
- 🔋 **Low Power Consumption** – Optimized for efficient operation.  

## 🛠 Requirements

Ensure you have the following components and dependencies:

- **Microcontroller** (e.g., STM32, ATmega, ESP32, etc.)  
- **Nixie Tubes** (e.g., IN-12, IN-14, IN-18, etc.)  
- **Nixie HV Power Supply** (150V DC)  
- **RTC Module** (DS1307)  
- **RS485 Transceiver** (MAX485)  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ketonkeko/Nixie-Tube-Driver-with-RTC-RS485.git
   cd Nixie-Tube-Driver-with-RTC-RS485
   ```

2. **Get Gerber Files for Manufacturing**  
   - open the zip file and get drill and copper gerber files
